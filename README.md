# Weekend SQL To-Do List

Create a full stack application that allows the user to make a to-do list and cross items off the list when a task is completed. 

## Technologies 
* JQuery
* SQL
* Node
* Express and Bodyparser 
* Working with Postico 

## Client Needs: 
* User should be able to create a Task (input fields, submit button)
* Tasks created should be stored in a database table 
* New tasks in the database should be fetched and rendered on DOM for client to see
* Each task comes with a Completed ✅ button that changes the task to be COMPLETE, and updates the appearance on the DOM (i.e. background change, cross off the text)
    * Perhaps include a Delete ❌ button to REMOVE a task from the list if user chooses to NOT do the task? 
* The database should also be updated accordingly if there is a Completed or Deleted task!

# Description
